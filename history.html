            <p><span class="smoltitle">From Tragedy to Travel</span><br>This is James "Quindingus" Ryan the original creator of Ryan's Ranch. He founght in the Mexican war many years ago and after years of struggling and 
                risking his life he wanted to make a new life for himself. Upon starting anew he founded Ryan's Ranch in 1935 with only one donkey named Brian. After years
                 of work he decided to go into the tourism buisness and began renting the ranch out for anyone who would like it. Once the WW2 began he was drafted back into 
                 the military where he served once again. After returning from war the second time he was found dead in his own home from an apparent burgulary gone wrong.
                  His children decided to carry on the tradition of the ranch in his memory and we recieve guests to this day.
