                They are also used in other events around the ranch. You could say these three are the stars of the show. Your can't be a real ranch 
                if you don't have a few horses.

                 to have another one named Bertha but Brisket night was a couple weeks ago.

                 but fear not, Chadwick spends most of his time at the pool so he has no issue with heat (other than himself).

        <p><br><br><br><br><span class="smoltitle">Other Members of Our Ranch</span><br>These are the starts of our show, however there are many other animals that are not in the foreground 
            that we hold in our stables that are not for commercial use. We offer a housing program where people can pay to store a horse in our stable or even other animals in our pens like chickens, pigs or goats. 
            Livestock animals aren't used as much in shows because we would perfer not to become great friends with what we will eventually eat. Many of the meat eaten on
             our community nights or large meals are raised and prepared all inside of the ranch. If you would like to call you can learn more about this process and maybe 
             even take part in it.
